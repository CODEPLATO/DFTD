Doorbell for the Deaf (DFTD)
====

## Introduction/Sypnosis
Microcontroller code behind the creation of a vibration doorbell for the deaf.

## Sharing of code on GITHUB

We chose GITHUB as a platform for storing our code instead of dropbox for the following reasons:

1. 
2. Documentation for our code
3. Multiple persons can work on the same code (but preferably not unless youâ€™re already familiar with git) at the same time.
        working on separate documents (different folders different code) in parellel is readily supported


## Prerequisites

1. [Commandline IDE](http://inotool.org/) for uploading code into the arduino board. (See [quick tutorial](http://inotool.org/quickstart))
 * Reason for chosing a command line (terminal) ide instead of the GUI is it allows easy integration into scripts eg. python/perl/bash
2. picocom (serial monitor)
3. Python (Anaconda Distribution)
